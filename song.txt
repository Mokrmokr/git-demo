I can't keep on
Losin' you over complications
Gone too soon, wait!
We was just hangin'
I can't seem to hold onto
Dang

The people that know me best
The key that I won't forget, too soon
I can't keep on losin' you
I can't keep on losin' you

Yeah
Yeah, yeah
How many mistakes do it take 'til you leave
And I'm left with my hand on my face, all red
In the face, lookin' at you like "wait!"
I know I ain't a saint, if it ain't too late, well...
(I can't keep on losin' you) Don't run away so fast
Know my heart like gold, but it break like glass
Know my shit get old and I act so young
Baby, you so cold, never have no sun
You don't wanna grow up, yeah, that shit no fun
So when I get home, I'ma give you some
Make you feel like (Woo) when I hit that drum
Yeah, the dick ain't free, I don't give no fucks
Yeah, it's complicated, got you frustrated
Get home late and you don't trust me, baby
Way too drunk, you don't know what I'm sayin'
You can drive my car, don't drive me crazy
Complicated, got you frustrated
Every single night I keep you waitin'
You say you don't care, that's what you sayin'?
We both know that's some bullshit
Okay, we be fightin', we be reunitin'
Kiss me, touch me, tease me, me excited
God, the devil, who is who?
Tryna get through to you because...
